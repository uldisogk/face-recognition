# Models and functions for face detection and recognition.

This repository contains models (or links to them) and convenience functions to build face detection and recognition systems as well as few Jupyter Notebooks with usage examples.

Every face recognition system can devided into two parts - face detection and face recognition. For face detection here are two options - multitask cascaded convolutional network (MTCNN) or histogram of oriented gradients (HOG).
Face recognition part is based on face embeddings created with FaceNet. These 128D vectors can then be easely compared by calculating euclidean distance or train classification model.
